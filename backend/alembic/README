# Alembic Migrations

## Usage

### Create a new migration
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback migrations
```bash
alembic downgrade -1  # Rollback 1 step
alembic downgrade base  # Rollback all
```

### View migration history
```bash
alembic history
alembic current
```

## Important

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
- Test migrations on staging before production
- Keep migrations reversible (implement downgrade)
- Never modify applied migrations
